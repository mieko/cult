This is project is managed by [Cult][1].  You'll need to install it to do
anything useful.

## A Tour

Cult projects have a defined directory structure:

  * `keys/{public,private}`: SSH keys you'll need to log in to the fleet.  Cult
    will work without these, assuming the keys you'll need are known to SSH when
    you try to command nodes.  It is up to your policy if `keys/private` gets
    checked into source control.
  * `nodes/(nodename)`: Nodes are created by the `cult nodes create your-node-name`
    command, and live here.  A node represents information about a living,
    breathing actual machine out there.
  * `roles/(rolename)`: A node has one or more roles.  When you synchronize a
    node, it's applying rules to conform to its role.  Generate new roles with
    `cult roles create your-role-name`
  * `vps`: Configuration for your VPS.
